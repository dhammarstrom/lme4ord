#### Edge-based phylogenetic GLMMs

Acknowledgements:  Ben Bolker, Jarrod Hadfield, and Guillaume Blanchet
have provided extremely useful discussions.

Here's some new stuff that I'm excited about, mostly because it seems
to solve a huge computational cost problem with Ives and Helmus style
PGLMMs, and just because it is interesting.  The idea is to avoid all
of the computationally expensive linear algebra involved when dealing
with dense phylogenetic covariance matrices.  Instead, from an idea
Ben and I had after a discussion with Jerrod Hadfield, we have a
random effect for each edge.  These effects act on all species that
descend from the particular edge in question.

Here's a simple simulated example with twenty sites and ten species,
but there is absolutely no problem with scaling this up (that's one of
the main points).  This example also shows off the nice modularized
fitting in `lme4ord`.

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 6}
td <- simTestPhyloDat(1, n = 100, m = 5, power = 0.5,
                      y ~ 1 + (1 | species),
                      covarSim = 1,
                      fixefSim = 1)
color2D.matplot(td$dl$y, xlab = "species", ylab = "sites",
                main = "Occurrence")
plot(td$ph)
edgelabels()
```

We find an indicator matrix giving the relationships between the edges
(plotted above on the phylogeny) and the tips (also plotted).

```{r}
(edgeMat <- edgeTipIndicator(td$ph))
```

Now we add this matrix to the data.

```{r}
(mod <- glmerc(y ~ 1 + (1 | species), as.data.frame(td$dl), binomial,
               strList = list(species = edgeMat)))
```

And here are some plots of the output, including the full covariance
matrix for the entire system and the phylogeny with the estimated edge
effects.

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4}
rho <- environment(mod$dfun)
with(rho$pp, image(crossprod(Lambdat %*% Zt)))
```

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 4}
plot(td$ph)
edgelabels(round(rho$pp$b(1), 2), cex = 1)
```

This plot gives the estimated phylogenetic effects on community
structure on each branch.  The link-scale effects for each species are
simply the sums of the values on the branches leading to them.

And it scales well!  Here's an example with 100 sites and 500 species.

```{r, big mod, echo = 3}
td <- simTestPhyloDat(1, n = 100, m = 500, power = 0.1,
                      y ~ 1 + (1 | species),
                      covarSim = 1, fixefSim = 1)
edgeMat <- edgeTipIndicator(td$ph)
system.time(mod <- glmerc(y ~ 1 + (1 | species),
                          as.data.frame(td$dl), binomial,
                          strList = list(species = edgeMat)))
```

`glmerc` (below) can't do that!  I think the reason for the speed is
the following sparsity pattern, which gives the numbers of species
'shared' by pairs of edges.

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
image(as(tcrossprod(edgeMat), "sparseMatrix"))
```

#### phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models!

Acknowledgements:  Ben Bolker, Tony Ives, and Guillaume Blanchet have 
provided invaluable discussions, advice, and encouragement.  Ben Bolker
has also provided valuable money.

The idea is to be able to fit a `glmer` model where there is a known
(e.g. phylogenetic) correlation structure over the levels of the
random effects grouping factors.  The function `glmerc` (for `glmer`
with known *C*ovariance over levels) can be used for this purpose.  In
terms of phylogenetic theory, the `glmerc` function essentially fits
the
[almost creationist](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2013/10/11/is-it-time-to-retire-pagels-lambda.html)
Pagel's lambda model within a generalized linear mixed model
framework.  Technically, Pagel's lambda is much easier to work with in
`lme4` because it doesn't require an expensive Cholesky decomposition
at each evaluation of the deviance function, whereas other models do
require this.  Nevertheless, the ultimate plan is to extend the range
of models, and the modular structure of `lme4` and `lme4ord` make this
[fairly easy to experiment with](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19327088/reproducing-results-from-previous-answer-is-not-working-due-to-using-new-version/19382162#19382162).
`lme4ord` is still very much in the development stage however and I
would love to get feedback.

In the example below, we simulate data and fit such a model.  The call will look like this.


```r
glmerc(y ~ x * z + (x | species), data,
       covList = list(species = Vphy),
       family = binomial)
```

Here `y` is a 0-1 vector indicating which species were present at
which sites.  `x` and `z` are environmental variables (over the sites)
and traits (over the species).  `Vphy` is a phylogenetic covariance
matrix, which is tagged by `species` because this corresponds to a
particular grouping factor in the model formula.  The size of `Vphy`
therefore must equal the number of levels of `species`.

In `glmer` this model formula would fit a two-by-two covariance matrix
over the slope and intercept implied by the random effect term.  This
same covariance matrix is repeated over each of the levels of the
grouping factor, `species`.  Therefore, the full random effects
covariance matrix can be viewed as a Kronecker product between this
two-by-two matrix and an identity matrix of size given by the number
of levels.  In `glmerc`, this identity matrix is simply replaced by
what is given in `covList` for the relevant grouping factor, which in
this case is the phylogenetic covariance matrix, `Vphy`.

##### Simulations

Begin with initial simulations of a sites-by-species binary response
matrix, `y`, environmental variable, `x`, and trait `z`.
More interesting patterns between `y`, `x`, and `z` will be added below.
```{r, initial sims}
set.seed(10)
n <- 10
m <- 30
dl <- dims_to_vars(data.list(y = 1 * (matrix(rnorm(n * m), n, m) > 0),
                             x = rnorm(n), z = rnorm(m),
                             dimids = c("sites", "species")))
df <- as.data.frame(dl)
head(df)
```

Make up some silly phylogeny.

```{r, phylogeny sims}
phy <- rtree(n = m)
phy <- compute.brlen(phy, method = "Grafen", power = 0.5)
```

and estimate a phylogenetic covariance matrix, standardized to unit determinant.

```{r, covariance sims}
Vphy <- stanCov(vcv(phy))
dimnames(Vphy) <- rep(list(1:m), 2)
```

Here's the phylogeny (forget the species names) and the associated covariance matrix

```{r, plot phylogeny, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 6.5}
plot(phy)
image(as(Vphy, "sparseMatrix"))
```

Put the covariance matrix in a list, for model-input purposes -- the
idea is that there might be other covariance matrices (e.g. a spatial
one say).  It is important that the list element gets the name
`species` because this is the name of the grouping factor used in the
model formula below.

```{r, make the covList}
covList <- list(species = Vphy)
```

There is a formula interface.  This model has a fixed interaction
between the environment and the trait (with intercept and main effects
too), a random environmental slope and intercept with phylogenetic
correlations across species.  However, the phylogenetic nature of the
covariances is not set in the formula, but rather as an argument to
the `glmercFormula` function below, which makes up the formula parsing
module of the `glmerc` function.

```{r, formula parsing}
form <- y ~ x * z + (x | species)
parsedForm <- glmercFormula(form, df, covList = covList, strList = list())
```

Set the covariance parameters to something more interesting (i.e. with
a covariance between the slope and intercept).
```{r, update parsed formula}
covarSim <- c(0.5, -0.2, 0.5)
parsedForm <- within(parsedForm, Lambdat@x[] <- mapToCovFact(covarSim))
```
Update the simulations to reflect the new structure.
```{r, update simulations}
X <- model.matrix(nobars(form), df) # fixed effects design matrix
Z <- t(parsedForm$Lambdat %*% parsedForm$Zt) # random effects design
                                             # matrix with
                                             # phylogenetic
                                             # covariances
fixefSim <- rnorm(ncol(X)) # fixed effects
u <- rnorm(ncol(Z)) # whitened random effects
p <- plogis(as.numeric(X %*% fixefSim + Z %*% u)) # probability of observation
dl$y <- rbinom(nrow(df), 1, p) # presence-absence data
df <- as.data.frame(dl) # reconstruct the data frame with new
                        # structured response
```

Now we look at the new structure.  Here's the Cholesky factor of the
species covariance, and the covariance itself.

```{r, plot lambda, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
image(parsedForm$Lambdat)
image(crossprod(parsedForm$Lambdat))
``` 

The big four blocks represent the 2-by-2 covariance between intercept
and slope.  The covariances within these blocks represent phylogenetic
covariance.  the pattern here is more closely related species have
more similar intercepts and slopes (red blocks on the diagonal) but
more closely related species also have stronger negative correlations
between slope and intercept (blue blocks on off diagonal).

Here's the transposed random effects model matrix.  Those are 1's for
the intercepts in the first 30 rows and the environmental variable in
the second 30.

```{r, plot Zt, fig.width=7, fig.height=2}
image(parsedForm$Zt)
```

Here's the full covariance matrix (the large scale blocks reflect
phylogenetic correlations and the patterns within each block are due
to the environmental variable).

```{r, plot full cov, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
image(fullCov <- t(parsedForm$Zt) %*% crossprod(parsedForm$Lambdat) %*% parsedForm$Zt)
```

Here is the observed occurrence pattern of species among sites.

```{r, plot sim data, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
color2D.matplot(dl$y, xlab = "species", ylab = "sites", main = "abundance")
```

##### Fit the model

```{r, fit phylo model}
(mod <- glmerc(form, df, covList = covList))
```

and compare with the true parameter values.

```{r, compare fit and sim}
cbind(estimated = mod$opt$par, # estimated parameters
      true = c(covar = covarSim, fixef = fixefSim)) # true parameters
```

Looks great!  At least in this case.

#### mixed effects ordination!

```{r}
data(fish)
data(limn)
Y <- as.matrix(fish)
n <- nrow(Y)
m <- ncol(Y)
x <- as.vector(scale(limn$pH))
dl <- data.list(Y = t(Y), x = x,
                dimids = c("species", "sites"))
summary(dl)
```

Not done!

#### spatial models

No example yet, but the idea is to put a spatial covariance matrix
over the levels of a spatial grouping factor.  For example, you might
do something like this,

```r
glmerc(y ~ x + (x | sites), covList = list(sites = spatialCovMat))
```
