\title{\code{lme4ord}: community ecological mixed effects models with \code{lme4}}
\description{
The idea behind lme4ord is to provide a flexible platform (and
maybe one day an API) for using lme4 computational machinery to
fit generalized linear mixed models to ecological community
data. The reason for this package is that I have found that (1)
community data requires more flexibility than the standard lme4
interface can provide but that (2) lme4 can usually be hacked to
fit the required model. Although I am a community ecologist, it is
likely that lme4ord is more broadly useful. However, as a
community ecologist am mostly interested in the following types of
models:
\describe{
\item{1}{Factor analytic and structural equation latent variable models}
\item{2}{Models with phylogenetic correlations}
\item{3}{Models with spatial correlations}
}
